# About me

Hi, I am Junyuan Fang (房俊源 in Chinese). I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student at City University of Hong Kong (CityU), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [C. K. Michael Tse](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ax0J3TkAAAAJ&hl=en). I received the bachelor's degree from Guangdong  University of Technology (GDUT) in 2018, and master’s degree from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) in 2020, advised by Dr. [Jiajing Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EaqeskUAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Zibin Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WPC6ED4AAAAJ&hl=en). My research interests are in the area of Graph Mining. More specifically, I am focused on the area of graph neural networks including their theory foundations, adversarial robustness and applications. I also have a strong passion for the robustness optimization against cascading failures in Cyber-physical systems (CPS).
